# Introduction {#Introduction}

The VCF Tool Box (`r Biocpkg("TVTB")`) offers S4 classes and methods
to filter, summarise and visualise genetic variation data
stored in VCF files pre-processed by the
[Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep)
(VEP) [@RN1].
An [RStudio/Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web-application,
the Shiny Variant Explorer (*tSVE*),
provides a convenient interface to demonstrate those
functionalities integrated in a programming-free environment.

Currently, major functionalities in the `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` package include:

**A class to store recurrent parameters of genetic analyses**

* List of reference homozygote, heterozygote, and alternate homozygote
    genotype encodings
* Key of the INFO field where Ensembl VEP predictions are stored
    in the VCF file
* Suffix of the INFO fields where calculated data will be stored
* List of genomic ranges to analyse and visualise
* Parameters for parallel calculations (using `r Biocpkg("BiocParallel")`)

**Genotype counts and allele frequencies**

* Calculated from the data of an `ExpandedVCF` objects
    (*i.e.* bi-allelic records)
* Stored in INFO fields defined by the above suffixes
    + overall counts and frequencies (*i.e.* across all samples)
    + counts and frequencies within level(s) of phenotype(s)

**Classes of VCF filter rules**

* Filter rules applicable to the `fixed` slot of an `VCF` object
* Filter rules applicable to the `info` slot of an `VCF` object
* Filter rules applicable to Ensembl VEP predictions stored in a
    given INFO field
* A container for combinations of filter rules listed above
* Subset `VCF` objects using the above filter rules

# Installation {#Installation}

The VCF Tool Box can be installed using the following code:

```{r biocLite, eval=FALSE}
# Currently:
devtools::install_github("kevinrue/TVTB")
# When hosted on Bioconductor:
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("TVTB")
```

Once installed, the package can be loaded and attached as follows:

```{r library}
library(TVTB)
```

# Recurrent settings: TVTBparam {#TVTBparam}

Most functionalities in `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` require recurrent information
such as:

* Genotype encoding (homozygote reference, heterozygote, homozygote alternate),
* INFO key that contains the Ensembl VEP predictions in the VCF file,
* List of genomic ranges within which data must be summarised or visualised
    + affecting the genomic ranges to import from the VCF file 
* Suffixes of INFO keys where counts and frequencies of genotypes must be
    stored:
    + Counts and frequencies may be calculated for individual levels of
        selected phenotypes, in which case the data will be stored
        under INFO keys formed as `<phenotype>_<level>_<suffix>`,
    + Counts and frequencies across all samples are stored in INFO keys
        simply named `<suffix>`.
* Settings for parallel calculations.

\bioccomment{
INFO key suffixes should be considered carefully to avoid conflicts
with INFO keys already present in the `VCF` object.
}

To reduce the burden of repetition during programming, and to 
facilitate analyses using consistent sets of parameters,
`r Biocpkg("TVTB")` implements the `TVTBparam` class.
The `TVTBparam` class offer a container for parameters recurrently used
across the package.
A `TVTBparam` object may be initialised as follows:

```{r TVTBparamCreate}
tparam <- TVTBparam(Genotypes(
    ref = "0|0",
    het = c("0|1", "1|0", "0|2", "2|0", "1|2", "2|1"),
    alt = c("1|1", "2|2")),
    ranges = GenomicRanges::GRangesList(
        SLC24A5 = GenomicRanges::GRanges(
            seqnames = "15",
            IRanges::IRanges(
                start = 48413170, end = 48434757)
            )
        )
    )
```

`TVTBparam` objects have a convenient summary view and accessor methods:

```{r TVTBparamView}
tparam
```

In this example:

* **Genotypes**
    + Accessor: `genos(x)`
    + Class: `Genotypes`
    + Homozygote reference genotype is encoded `"0|0"`.
    + Counts of reference genotypes are stored in INFO keys suffixed with
        `"REF"`.
    + Heterozygote genotypes are encoded as
        `"0|1"`, `"1|0"`, `"0|2"`, `"2|0"`, `"1|2"`, and `"2|1"`.
    + Counts of heterozygote genotypes are stored in INFO keys suffixed with
        `"HET"`.
    + Homozygote alternate  genotype is encoded `"1|1"`.
    + Counts of alternate genotypes are stored in INFO keys suffixed with
        `"ALT"`.
* **Genomic ranges**
    + Accessor: `ranges(x)`
    + Class: `GRangesList`
    + A gene-coding region on chromosome `"15"`.
* **Alternate allele frequency**
    + Accessor: `aaf(x)`
    + Calculated values will be stored under INFO keys suffixed with `"AAF"`.
* **Minor allele frequency**
    + Accessor: `maf(x)`
    + Calculated values will be stored under INFO keys suffixed with `"MAF"`.
* **Ensembl VEP predictions**
    + Accessor: `vep(x)`
    + Information will be imported from the INFO field `"CSQ"`.
* **Parallel calculations**
    + Accessor: `bp(x)`
    + Class: `BiocParallelParam`
    + Serial evaluation (*i.e.* do not run parallel code)
* **VCF scan parameters**
    + Accessor: `svp(x)`
    + Class: `ScanVcfParam`
    + `which` slot automatically populated with `reduce(unlist(ranges(x)))`

Default values are provided for all slots except genotypes, as these may vary
more frequently from one data set to another (*e.g.* phased, unphased,
imputed).

# Data import {#Import}

## Genetic variants {#ImportVariants}

Functionalities in `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` support
`CollapsedVCF` and `ExpandedVCF` objects
(both extending the virtual class `VCF`) of the 
`r Biocpkg("VariantAnnotation")` package.

Typically, `CollapsedVCF` objects are produced by the
`r Biocpkg("VariantAnnotation")` `readVcf` method after parsing a VCF file,
and `ExpandedVCF` objects result of the
`r Biocpkg("VariantAnnotation")` `expand` method applied to
a `CollapsedVCF` object.

Any information that users deem relevant for the analysis may be
imported from VCF files and stored in
`VCF` objects passed to `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` methods.
However, to enable the key functionalities of the package,
the slots of a `VCF` object should include
at least the following information:

* `fixed(x)`
    + fields `"REF"` and `"ALT"`.
    
* `info(x)`
    + field `<vep>`: where `<vep>` stands for the INFO key where
        the Ensembl VEP predictions are stored in the `VCF` object.
    
* `geno(x)`
    + `GT`: genotypes.

* `colData(x)`: phenotypes.

## List of genomic ranges {#ImportGRangesList}

In the near future, `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` functionalities are expected to
produce summary statistics and plots faceted by meta-features,
each potentially composed of multiple genomic ranges.

For instance, burden tests may be performed on a set of transcripts,
considering only variants in their respective sets of exons.
The `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")` `GRangesList` class is an ideal container
in example,
as each `GRanges` in the `GRangesList` would represent a transcript,
and each element in the `GRanges` would represent an exon.

Furthermore, `TVTBparam` objects may be supplied as the `param`
argument of the `r Biocpkg("VariantAnnotation")` `readVcf`. In this case, the
`TVTBparam` object is used to import only variants overlapping
the relevant genomic regions.
Moreover, the `readVcf` method also ensured that the `vep` slot of the
`TVTBparam` object is present in the header of the VCF file.

```{r, reduceGRangesList}
svp <- as(tparam, "ScanVcfParam")
svp
```

## Phenotypes {#ImportPhenotypes}

Although `VCF` objects may be constructed without attached phenotype data,
phenotype information is critical to interpret and compare genetic variants
between groups of samples
(*e.g.* burden of damaging variants in different phenotype levels).

`VCF` objects accept phenotype information
(as `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` `DataFrame`) in the `colData` slot.
This practice has the key advantage of keeping phenotype and genetic
information synchronised through operation such as subsetting and re-ordering,
limiting workspace [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy)
and confusion.



## Example {#ImportExample}

An `ExpandedVCF` object that contains the minimal data necessary for the rest
of the vignette can be created as follows:

**Step 1:** Import phenotypes

```{r importPhenotypes}
phenoFile <- system.file(
    "extdata", "integrated_samples.txt", package = "TVTB")
phenotypes <- S4Vectors::DataFrame(
    read.table(file = phenoFile, header = TRUE, row.names = 1))
```

**Step 2:** Define the VCF file to parse

```{r vcfFile}
vcfFile <- system.file(
    "extdata", "chr15.phase3_integrated.vcf.gz", package = "TVTB")
tabixVcf <- Rsamtools::TabixFile(file = vcfFile)
```

**Step 3:** Define VCF import parameters

```{r ScanVcfParam}
VariantAnnotation::vcfInfo(svp(tparam)) <- vep(tparam)
VariantAnnotation::vcfGeno(svp(tparam)) <- "GT"
svp(tparam)
```

Of particular interest in the above chunk of code:

* The `TVTBparam` constructor previously populated the `which` slot of `svp`
    with "reduced" (*i.e.* non-overlapping)
    genomic ranges defined in the `ranges` slot.
* Only the INFO key defined in the `vep` slot will be imported
* Only the matrix of called genotypes will be imported

**Step 4:** Import and pre-process variants

```{r preprocessVariants, message=FALSE}
# Import variants as a CollapsedVCF object
vcf <- VariantAnnotation::readVcf(
    tabixVcf, param = tparam, colData = phenotypes)
# Expand into a ExpandedVCF object (bi-allelic records)
vcf <- VariantAnnotation::expand(x = vcf, row.names = TRUE)
```

Of particular interest in the above chunk of code, the `readVcf` method is
given:

* `TVTBparam` parameters, invoking the corresponding method signature
* phenotypes
    + The `rownames` of those phenotypes defines the sample identifiers that
        are queried from the VCF file.
    + Those phenotypes are stored in the `colData` slot of the resulting
        `VCF` object.

The result is an `ExpandedVCF` object that includes variants
in the targeted genomic range(s) and samples:

```{r vcf, echo=FALSE}
vcf
```

# Adding allele frequencies {#Frequencies}

Although interesting figures and summary tables may be obtained
as soon as the first `ExpandedVCF` object is created
(see section [Summarising Ensembl VEP predictions](#Summarise)),
those methods may benefit from information added to additional INFO keys
after data import, either manually by the user, or through various
methods implemented in the `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` package.

## Adding overall frequencies {#FrequenciesOverall}

For instance, the method `addOverallFrequencies` uses the
reference homozoygote (*REF*), heterozygote (*HET*),
and homozygote alternate (*ALT*) genotypes defined in the `TVTBparam` object
stored in the `VCF` metadata
to obtain the count of each genotype in an `ExpandedVCF` object.
Immediately thereafter, the method uses those counts to calculate
alternate allele frequency (*AAF*) and minor allele frequency (*MAF*).
Finally, the method stores the five calculated values
(*REF*, *HET*, *ALT*, *AAF*, and *MAF*)
in INFO keys defined by suffixes also declared in the `TVTBparam` object.

```{r addOverallFrequencies}
initialInfo <- colnames(info(vcf))
vcf <- addOverallFrequencies(vcf = vcf)
setdiff(colnames(info(vcf)), initialInfo)
```

Notably, the `addOverallFrequencies` method is synonym to the `addFrequencies`
method missing the argument `phenos`:

```{r addFrequenciesOverall}
vcf <- addFrequencies(vcf = vcf, force = TRUE)
```

\bioccomment{
The optional argument `force = TRUE` is used here
to overwrite INFO keys created in the previous chunk of code.
}

## Adding frequencies within phenotype level(s) {#FrequenciesPhenoLevel}

Similarly, the method `addPhenoLevelFrequencies` obtains the count of each
genotype in samples associated with given level(s) of given phenotype(s),
and stores the calculated values in INFO keys defined as 
`<pheno>_<level>_<suffix>`, with suffixes defined in the `TVTBparam` object
stored in the `VCF` metadata.

```{r addPhenoLevelFrequencies}
initialInfo <- colnames(info(vcf))
vcf <- addPhenoLevelFrequencies(
    vcf = vcf, pheno = "super_pop", level = "AFR")
setdiff(colnames(info(vcf)), initialInfo)
```

Notably, the `addPhenoLevelFrequencies` method is synonym
to the `addFrequencies`
method called with the argument `phenos` given as a list where `names` are
phenotypes, and values are `character` vectors of levels to
process within each phenotype:

```{r addFrequenciesPhenoLevel}
initialInfo <- colnames(info(vcf))
vcf <- addFrequencies(
    vcf = vcf, phenos = list(
        super_pop = c("EUR", "AFR"),
        pop = c("GBR", "FIN", "MSL")),
    force = TRUE)
setdiff(colnames(info(vcf)), initialInfo)
```

# Filtering variants {#Filter}

Although `VCF` objects are straightforward to subset
using either indices and row names
(as they inherit from the `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` 
`RangedSummarizedExperiment` class),
users may wish to identify variants that pass combinations of criteria based on
information in their `fixed` slot, `info` slot, and Ensembl VEP predictions,
a non-trivial task due to those pieces of information being stored in
different slots of the `VCF` object, and the *1:N* relationship
between variants and EnsemblVEP predictions.

## Definition of VCF filter rules {#FilterDefine}

To facilitate the definition of VCF filter rules, and their application to
`VCF` objects, `r Biocpkg("TVTB")` extends the `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")`
`FilterRules` class in four new classes of filter rules:

```{r filterRulesMotivation, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
motivations <- data.frame(
    Class = c(
        "`VcfFixedRules`", "`VcfInfoRules`", "`VcfVepRules`",
        "`VcfFilterRules`"
    ),
    Motivation=c(
        sprintf(
            "Filter rules applied to the `%s` slot of a `VCF` object.",
            c("fixed", "info")),
        paste(
            "Filter rules applied to the Ensembl VEP predictions",
            "stored in a given INFO key of a `VCF` object."),
        paste(
            "Combination of `VcfFixedRules`, `VcfInfoRules`, and",
            "`VcfVepRules` applicable to a `VCF` object."
        )
    )
)
pander::pandoc.table(
    motivations,
    paste(
        "Motivation for each of the new classes extending `FilterRules`,
        to define VCF filter rules."
    ),
    style = "multiline",
    split.cells = c(15, 45),
    split.tables = c(Inf)
)
```

Note that `FilterRules` objects themselves are applicable to `VCF` objects,
with two important difference from the above specialised classes:

* Expressions must explicitely refer to the `VCF` slots
* As a consequence, a single expression can refer to fields from different
    `VCF` slots, for instance:

```{r FilterRules}
fr <- S4Vectors::FilterRules(list(
    mixed = function(x){
        VariantAnnotation::fixed(x)[,"FILTER"] == "PASS" &
            VariantAnnotation::info(x)[,"MAF"] >= 0.05
    }
))
fr
```

Instances of those classes may be initialised as follows:

**VcfFixedRules**

```{r VcfFixedRules}
fixedR <- VcfFixedRules(list(
    pass = expression(FILTER == "PASS"),
    qual = expression(QUAL > 20)
    ))
fixedR
```

**VcfInfoRules**

```{r VcfInfoRules}
infoR <- VcfInfoRules(exprs = list(
    common = expression(MAF > 0.1), # minor allele frequency
    present = expression(ALT + HET > 0) # count of non-REF homozygotes
    ),
    active = c(TRUE, FALSE))
infoR
```

`FilterRules` are initialised in an active state by default.
The above chunk of code demonstrate how the `active` argument
of their constructor may be used to initialise
specific filter rules in an inactive state.

**VcfVepRules**

```{r VcfVepRules}
vepR <- VcfVepRules(exprs = list(
    missense = expression(Consequence %in% c("missense_variant")),
    CADD = expression(CADD_PHRED > 15)
    ))
vepR
```

**VcfFilterRules**

`VcfFilterRules` combine VCF filter rules of  different types
in a single object.

```{r VcfFilterRules}
vcfRules <- VcfFilterRules(fixedR, infoR, vepR)
vcfRules
```

This vignette offers only a brief peek into the utility and flexibility of
VCF filter rules. More (complex) examples are given in a separate
vignette, including filter rules using functions and pattern matching.
The documentation of the `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` package---where the parent
class `FilterRules` is defined---can also be a source of inspiration.

## Control of VCF filter rules {#FilterControl}

As the above classes of *VCF filter rules* inherit
from the `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` `FilterRules` class,
they also benefit from its accessors and methods.
For instance, VCF filter rules can easily be toggled
between active and inactive states:

```{r deactivateCADD}
active(vcfRules)["CADD"] <- FALSE
active(vcfRules)
```

A separate vignette describes in greater detail the use of classes
that contain *VCF filter rules*.

## Evaluation of VCF filter rules {#FilterEval}

Once defined, the above filter rules can be applied to `ExpandedVCF` objects,
in the same way as `FilterRules` are evaluated in a given environment
(see the `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` documentation):

```{r}
summary(eval(expr = infoR, envir = vcf))
summary(eval(expr = vcfRules, envir = vcf))
summary(evalSeparately(expr = vcfRules, envir = vcf))
```

\bioccomment{
Note how the inactive rule `CADD` returns `TRUE` for all variants.
}

# Summarising Ensembl VEP predictions {#Summarise}

As soon as genetic and phenotypic information are imported
into an `ExpandedVCF` object,
or after the object was extended with additional information,
the scientific value of the data may be revealed by
a variety of summary statistics and graphical representations.
This section will soon present several ideas *being implemented* in
`r Biocpkg("TVTB")`, for instance:

* Count of discrete Ensembl VEP predictions
    + by phenotype level
    + by genomic feature affected (*i.e.* transcript)
* Distribution of continuous Ensembl VEP predictions
    + by phenotype level
    + by genomic feature affected (*i.e.* transcript)
